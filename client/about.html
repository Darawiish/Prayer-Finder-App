       <p>يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا۟ إِذَا نُودِىَ لِلصَّلَوٰةِ مِن يَوْمِ ٱلْجُمُعَةِ فَٱسْعَوْا۟ إِلَىٰ ذِكْرِ ٱللَّهِ وَذَرُوا۟ ٱلْبَيْعَ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ خَيْرٌۭ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</p>

            <li> A talk or sermon delivered in mosques before the Friday prayer.The sermon consists of two distinct parts, between which the Khatib (speaker) must sit down for a short time of rest.</li>
            
        <li>There should not be an undue interval or irrelevant action intervening between the sermon and the prayer. "It should preferably be in Arabic, especially the Qur'anic passage which has to be recited in the sermon. Otherwise, it should be given in the language understood by the majority of the faithful who are there. In this case the preacher should first recite in Arabic Qurʾānic verses praising God and Muhammad."</li>

            <ol>1. "The praise and glorification of Allah.</ol>
            <ol>2. Invocation of blessings on Muhammad and his progeny</ol>
            <ol>3. Enjoining the participants Taqwa, admonition and exhortations. </ol>
            <ol>4.Reciting short surah from Quran</ol>

            - Also, in addition to the above issues, the following were advised to be addressed in the second sermon:

            1. What will be useful for all Muslims in this world and hereafter.
            2. The important events all over the world in favor of or disfavor of Muslims.
            3. Special attention should be paid to issues in the Muslim world.
            4. Political and economical aspects of the society and worldwide.

            - Attendants must listen attentively to the sermon and avoid any action that might distract their attentions.

            - The Prophet Muhammad "has forbidden a person with his knees drawn up touching his abdomen while the imam is delivering the Friday sermon."</li>
